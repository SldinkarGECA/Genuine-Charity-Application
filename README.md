## 📃 Description

* We have created a Solidity Smart Contract for this cause and we have used web3, ganache-cli, mocha, to test out our contract.

* In the contracts folder, you will find a final solidity contract and the individual modules inside contracts_classified directory.

* On the Frontend Part we have html,css,javascript and full UI of Genuine Charity App along with Admin Panel in the website folder.

* Included a test directory with a test file to test all the functions used in the contract by deploying it on ganache and using web3 to utilize the ABI.

* Included a sample React Template so that the frontend can be used to include the website along with the test code to make a production app.

* Included code to compile the contract and to deploy the contract on the Rinkeby Test Network using the Infuria node module.

* The website and the test modules are not yet connected and the code is placed in seperate folders.

## 📝Applications
> Many fake charity organizations pose as genuine and loot money from innocent people in the name of charity. Most people want to donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of the destitute.  The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.

## 👨‍🎓What did we learn from this project

1. Shreyas Penkar - </br> It was awesome working as a leader in this project. I learnt how Blockchains work giving me a clear understanding of the various moving pieces and concepts regarding Blockchain. I was able to contribute to a solidity contract and write tests for the same. I gained many useful skills related to management, leadership, team-work and also got to know a lot about my co-workers and mentors. It was fun working with them on this project. So, overall it was a huge success.

4. Aishwarya Harkare - </br> Collaborating with the team was indeed wonderful experience for me. Working on this project I could dive into the whole new world of Blockchain Technology.I learnt Smart Contract , Solidity programming language through this project. I got to write a bit of Smart Contract for this Application. Further, I coordinated with my collegue Purva Anjarlekar in making Frontend of the website. Working with Teammates and mentors helped me gain skills such as team-work , communication skills. Thus, this was a great adventure for me.
5. Rohan Sawai - </br> It was an incredible experience for me. I got to learn the concept of Blockchain technology and various concepts related to Blockchain. As a member of this team, I contributed to the Solidity contract, a small part of frontend and also wrote tests. I learned skills like team-work, time-management and how to effectively communicate with my team. Furthermore, would like to thank our leader, Shreyas and mentors for guiding me right from basic learning resources. Overall it was an amazing experience!

## 🔮Future scope
* As the frontend is not yet connected to the contract, we could first connect it using a sample node server or by using React.
* Make the UI/UX even better.
* Make an Andriod app for this idea.
